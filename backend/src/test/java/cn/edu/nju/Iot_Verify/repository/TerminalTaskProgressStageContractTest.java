/**
 * A task that has stopped must not publish a stage that says it is still working.
 *
 * Every member of {@code TaskProgressStage} names work in progress — {@code QUEUED},
 * {@code GENERATING_MODEL}, {@code EXECUTING_MODEL_CHECKER}, {@code RUNNING_SIMULATION},
 * {@code EXPLORING_CANDIDATES}, {@code PERSISTING_RESULT} — and there is no terminal member. So a terminal
 * transition that does not clear the column leaves whatever stage the worker was in when it stopped.
 *
 * Observed on a live run before the fix: {@code status: COMPLETED, progress: 100,
 * progressStage: PERSISTING_RESULT} — a finished simulation still claiming to be saving its result. Eleven of
 * the twelve terminal transitions across the three task repositories had the same gap.
 *
 * The web client hid it ({@code activeTaskProgressStage} returns null for terminal statuses), but six AI tools
 * publish the field raw, so an agent asked about a finished run reported it as still persisting. This is the
 * same class of defect as {@code progress} once being forced to 100 on a task that never finished: a field whose
 * value contradicts {@code status}.
 *
 * Asserted against the JPQL text because these are {@code @Modifying} queries with no return value to inspect —
 * a behavioural test would need a worker lease per repository, and this states the invariant directly.
