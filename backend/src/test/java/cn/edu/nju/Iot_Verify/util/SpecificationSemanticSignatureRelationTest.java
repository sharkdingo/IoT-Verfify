/**
 * A specification's identity must not depend on how its relation was spelled.
 *
 * <p>`exactlyMatches` gates "delete this specification only if it has not changed" and duplicate-spec detection,
 * so a signature that disagrees with itself over an alias lets a delete land on a specification the user edited.
 *
 * <p>This class exists because the relation normaliser here was a **private copy** of the switch in
 * {@code SmvRelationUtils}, and the copy had drifted: its {@code NEQ} case omitted the {@code "!="} alias the
 * canonical version carries. The two agreed only through the passthrough default, so adding an alias to the
 * generator alone would have split them silently — and the suite had no direct test of this class at all, only
 * indirect coverage through {@code BoardStorageServiceImpl}'s delete paths. The normaliser now delegates to
 * {@code SmvRelationUtils}; these assertions pin the property that matters rather than the delegation itself.
