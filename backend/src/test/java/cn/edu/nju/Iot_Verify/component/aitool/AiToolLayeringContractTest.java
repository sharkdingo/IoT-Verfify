/**
 * An AI tool must reach the database through the service layer, never a repository.
 *
 * <p>This is what makes an assistant-made board change as safe as a hand-made one, and it is entirely structural.
 * The services own the per-user write lock, the ownership check, and — critically — the
 * {@code BoardEditJournal.record} call that happens inside the mutation's own transaction. A tool that injected a
 * repository directly would bypass all three: the change would commit, it would be invisible to the journal, and
 * {@code /api/board/edits/availability} would correctly report that there is nothing to undo. The user's rule
 * would simply be gone, permanently, with no error anywhere.
 *
 * <p>{@code BoardStorageController} states the reason this cannot be patched client-side: "the journal on the
 * server is the authority for what is reversible, so the client sends no local history." There is no second place
 * to catch the omission.
 *
 * <p>Verified live before writing this: a rule created through the service path reported {@code canUndo=true},
 * undo removed it, redo restored it; a device rename was journalled and undo restored the *exact* previous label;
 * and a rename carrying a stale {@code expectedLabel} was refused with 409 while the newer human edit survived.
 * The layering is currently clean — 53 tools reference a service, zero reference a repository.
 *
 * <p>Source-level on purpose. The failure is an import plus a constructor parameter, which compiles, passes a
 * happy-path Mockito test, and works perfectly in manual testing. Nothing else in the suite would notice.
