/**
 * The one definition of a legal device-template name.
 *
 * <p>Previously three copies of a `^[\x20-\x7E]+$` pattern each carried the same comment, which is
 * how they could drift. The real constraint is narrower than "printable ASCII": `(user_id, name)`
 * uniqueness is case-insensitive, so {@code Locale.ROOT toLowerCase} and MySQL {@code LOWER()} must
 * agree on the name. Only *cased* letters can make them disagree (Turkish dotted I, U+1E9B, and
 * similar); a caseless script cannot, because lowercasing is the identity for it in both engines.
 *
 * <p>Rejecting all non-ASCII therefore refused legitimate names such as {@code 温度传感器} or
 * {@code Wärmepumpe} for no benefit, while device labels on the same board accept any Unicode and
 * the project is UTF-8 throughout.
 *
 * <p>This is <em>not</em> NuSMV identifier safety. Variable, mode, and state tokens must match
 * {@code ^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$} and are validated separately; a template name is display metadata
 * and never becomes an SMV identifier.
