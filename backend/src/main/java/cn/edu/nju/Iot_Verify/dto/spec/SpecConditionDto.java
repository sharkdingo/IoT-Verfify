     * attack modelling the two are provably equal; a compromised device may report a value the environment
     * never held, and then they diverge. Measured before this field existed: a specification reading
     * "temperature never exceeds 30" was reported SATISFIED while a falsified reading reached 40 and the
     * rule fired, because the builder always chose the pool value and silently dropped the device the
     * author had picked.

     * <p>Deliberately has **no default**. A null value means the author never chose, which is a real and
     * distinct state for every specification written before this field: presenting either value as their
     * intent is the defect being fixed. Generation refuses such a condition and reports it as a skipped
     * specification rather than guessing, and the client renders it as unresolved rather than as a verdict.
