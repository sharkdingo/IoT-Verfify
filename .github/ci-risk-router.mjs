/**
 * Decides which CI tiers a change needs, from the paths it touches.
 *
 * This is a script rather than inline YAML because the decision is real logic with real consequences
 * — routing a formal-model change away from full validation would let an unsound verdict reach main —
 * and logic that matters deserves tests. `ci-risk-router.test.mjs` exercises it directly.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately *not* "small diff means small pipeline". A one-line change to a security
 * filter, a migration, a shared contract, or the NuSMV generator is exactly the kind of edit whose
 * blast radius has nothing to do with its size. So every path maps to an area, and areas — not
 * counts — select the tier.
 *
 * Fail-safe direction: anything unrecognised escalates to full validation. A new top-level directory
 * should cost a slow pipeline, not silently bypass one.
