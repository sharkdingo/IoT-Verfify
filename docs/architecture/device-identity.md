# Device Identity Authority

This project is in active development, so device identity is intentionally strict.
There is no label/template fallback compatibility layer.

Verified against code on 2026-07-11. Source: board storage, node creation,
scene recommendation/import, model request conversion, traces, and fix apply.

For the full field-level contract across devices, rules, specs, traces, tasks, and
fix, see [Data authority model](data-authority-model.md).

## Canonical Contract

| Surface | Authoritative value | Display-only value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Board node | System/scene-provided `DeviceNode.id` | User-provided `DeviceNode.label` |
| Rule source / command | Raw node id in board storage; normalized `varName` at model boundary | Rule text / labels |
| Specification condition | Raw node id in board storage; normalized `varName` at model boundary | `SpecConditionDto.deviceLabel` |
| Specification selected device | Raw node id in board storage; normalized `varName` at model boundary | `DeviceRefDto.deviceLabel` |
| NuSMV device variable | `DeviceVerificationDto.varName`, derived from node id | none |
| AI tools on an existing board | `deviceId` / node id | `deviceName` / `deviceLabel` |
| Complete AI scene draft | Backend-assigned portable id after alias rewriting | Recommended device label |
| Fix candidates | Resolved canonical id / SMV varName | none |

## Rules

- `DeviceNode.id` is the only persistent device identity.
- Ordinary UI creation and `add_device` generate this id independently of the display
  label. A full-replacement AI scene draft treats LLM ids as temporary aliases and rewrites every
  dependency to backend-assigned portable ids before returning the scene.
- An explicitly supplied display label is exact across manual and AI creation. A
  case-insensitive conflict performs no write and returns an available suggestion; only
  an omitted system-generated label may receive an automatic suffix.
- Standard scene JSON preserves explicit ids exactly so export/import remains lossless;
  it never silently renames a conflicting id.
- Device ids must also be unique after NuSMV normalization; two raw ids that map to the
  same `varName` are rejected at board save.
- Board save also rejects a stable id that would collide with the current scene's
  generated environment, rule-playback, attack-analysis, or existing-condition fix
  identifiers. The validation error is attached to `nodes[i].id`; the display label may
  remain unchanged.
- `DeviceNode.templateName` is the device's semantic template pointer and must match
  an existing template for the same user; deleting an in-use template is rejected.
- `label`, `deviceLabel`, `deviceName` labels, and template names are never used as
  identity fallback.
- Renaming a device changes display labels only. Rules, specs, traces, AI references,
  and fix candidates continue to target the same node id.
- Deleting a device removes dependent rules/specs by node id only.
- Rule conditions must provide `targetType` (`api`, `variable`, `mode`, or `state`);
  backend modeling does not infer semantics from the attribute name.
- Rule `targetType=api` conditions may reference only template APIs with
  `Signal=true` and must not include relation/value; rule commands may invoke any
  template API.
- Spec conditions must provide `deviceId` and `targetType`. `deviceLabel` is a UI
  snapshot and is ignored by validation/resolution.
- AI tools operating on an existing board must use canonical node ids. Scene-generation
  tools may use response-local aliases, which are never persisted directly. Returned
  labels are for readable UI text only.
- NuSMV and fix code resolve device references from canonical ids and fail fast on
  unknown ids.
- NuSMV variable names are derived from node ids with the shared safe-normalization
  algorithm: non-`[a-zA-Z0-9_]` characters become `_`, letters are lowercased, a leading
  digit is prefixed with `_`, and NuSMV reserved words are prefixed with `_`. The raw
  board node id remains the persisted identity; the normalized name is the model/trace
  boundary representation.

If old local data was saved with labels as identity, clear the development database or
recreate the affected board data instead of adding compatibility branches.
