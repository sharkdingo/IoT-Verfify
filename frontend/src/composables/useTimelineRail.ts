/**
 * Timeline rail interaction logic: pointer scrubbing, keyboard navigation, and button scrolling.
 *
 * This composable extracts the shared behavior between the counterexample trace rail (Board.vue) and
 * the simulation timeline rail (SimulationTimeline.vue). Both rails map a horizontal x-axis to a
 * discrete state index, support pointer capture for drag-scrubbing, roving tabindex for keyboard
 * navigation, and scroll-into-view for button reveal.
 *
 * The visual presentation (rail height, button size, colors, violation markers) remains in each
 * component's template — this composable owns only the *interaction algorithms*, not the styling.
 *
 * @param options.totalStates - Reactive count of states in the sequence
 * @param options.selectedStateIndex - Reactive currently-selected state index
 * @param options.onSelectState - Callback to invoke when the user selects a new state (via pointer, keyboard, or programmatic call)
 * @param options.testIdPrefix - The `data-testid` prefix for querying rail elements (e.g., 'trace-timeline' or 'simulation-timeline')
 *
 * @returns Rail interaction handlers and utilities
