/**
 * The cycle the replay bar names must be the cycle the backend marked.
 *
 * NuSMV closes a lasso counterexample by re-printing its loop-entry state, and it can print
 * `-- Loop starts here` **more than once** in a single counterexample. The backend resolves that
 * deliberately and documents the choice: `SmvTraceParser` overwrites `loopStartState` on every marker, so
 * the state it pairs with `loopBack` is the one the **last** marker points at —
 * `SmvTraceParserTest.parseCounterexample_usesTheLastMarkerWhenNuSmvPrintsSeveral` asserts a five-state
 * trace where states 3 and 4 both carry `loopStart` and only state 5 carries `loopBack`.
 *
 * The frontend then has to agree, because it renders a *sentence about formal evidence*:
 * "State {end} loops back to state {start}". Reading the first marker instead of the last names a cycle
 * the counterexample does not contain — a wrong claim about a proof, in the one place a reader goes to
 * understand why the final step shows no movement.
 *
 * Asserted over the source rather than by mounting `Board.vue` (far too large to mount cheaply, per
 * `actionDockHierarchy.spec.ts`), plus a behavioural check of the resolution rule itself on the exact
 * state shape the backend test pins.
