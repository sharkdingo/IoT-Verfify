/**
 * Which reading(s) a verdict answered about, as i18n keys.
 *
 * A verification result row is titled by its specification *template* ("Never", "Always"), so two
 * specifications asking different questions about the same key — the case the `variableSource`
 * distinction exists for — render as identical rows that can carry opposite verdicts. The only other
 * difference on screen is one token inside a monospace formula, which is not an explanation.
 *
 * Returns keys rather than text so the caller owns translation, and returns them in first-seen order,
 * de-duplicated. A specification that mixes both readings yields both: that is precisely when the
 * distinction matters most, so collapsing it would hide the point. A condition that never chose maps
 * to the unresolved key rather than being dropped, because a verdict about an unanswered question is
 * something the user needs to see.
