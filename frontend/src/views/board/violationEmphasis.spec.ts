 * Arriving at the violating step must change the canvas, not only the rail.

 * The rail marked the step with a ring and an 11px label from the start of playback, but during playback
 * the eye is on the canvas — and reaching the violating state changed nothing there: autoplay simply
 * called `stopTraceAnimation()` on the last state. The run's whole purpose arrived in silence.
 *
 * Measured in a browser on `acceptance-demo-scene.json`: step 0 → 0 emphasised nodes, step 1 →
 * 1 (`camera_1`, the device the violated specification binds), returning to step 0 → 0 again.
