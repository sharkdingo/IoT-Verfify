/**
 * Deleting a run must close every surface still showing it.
 *
 * Found by behaviour, not by reading: run a sync verification, leave the result dialog open, delete that
 * run, then click its model download. Measured on the running app — the dialog stayed open, the download
 * stayed enabled, and the click answered *"SMV model not available (may be a record saved before model
 * persistence was enabled)"*. Two separate defects in one journey:
 *
 * 1. `deleteVerificationRun` removed the run from the history list and nothing else, so the dialog kept
 *    rendering a verdict, per-specification results and counterexample evidence for a record the server
 *    had already deleted — a result surface outliving its own run.
 * 2. That 404 message named a cause the client cannot know. The server's 404 covers *two* states, "the
 *    run is gone" and "the run stored no model", and the copy asserted the second as fact. So the
 *    explanation for a deletion one click old was a historical persistence limitation.
 *
 * Source-text assertions rather than a mounted render (`Board.vue` is far too large to mount cheaply,
 * per `actionDockHierarchy.spec.ts`).

 * rendering a run, its findings and its eligibility report for a record the server had dropped.
 *
 * The second defect here is the closer: `closeFuzzingResult` documents itself as *not* touching the URL
 * (it serves internal transitions such as opening a finding replay), and the delete handler used it — so
 * `?run=exploration:<id>` outlived its own run and the deep-link watcher would reload it.
