/**
 * A verdict that arrives after the board changed under it must arrive stale.
 *
 * `markVerificationResultStale` can only raise the flag on a result that *exists* — it reads
 * `verificationResult.value` / `lastSimulationResult.value` and returns early on null. Both run
 * paths null their result ref before submitting, so for the entire duration of a run there is
 * nothing to mark: a device edit, a rule change or an applied fix made while NuSMV is working
 * marked nothing at all. The completion paths then wrote `stale = false` unconditionally, so the
 * verdict presented itself as describing the canvas the user was now looking at — and kept offering
 * the per-counterexample Fix action, computed against a scene that no longer existed. That is the
 * one thing the repo's staleness rule exists to prevent.
 *
 * A watcher on the result ref cannot close this: the gap is precisely the window in which the ref
 * is null. The mechanism has to be a counter captured at submission and compared on arrival, which
 * is what this pins.
 *
 * It counts `semanticSceneChangeCount` rather than `boardMutationAdmissionEpoch` on purpose, and
 * the difference is load-bearing: the epoch counts *admitted mutations*, incremented before
 * `trackSemanticChange` is consulted, so the undo-history preview and clear advance it while
 * touching only the journal. Comparing that would mark a perfectly current verdict stale. The
 * counter increments inside `markVerificationResultStale` itself, so the two mechanisms cannot
 * disagree about what counts as a semantic change.
 *
 * Asserted over `Board.vue`'s source: the logic is inline in a component too large to mount
 * cheaply (see `actionDockHierarchy.spec.ts`), and extracting a comparison of one module-scoped
 * counter would need the reactive scope injected — the pass-through layer the frontend rules
 * forbid. `loopRangeAgreement.spec.ts` uses the same approach for the same reason.
