/**
 * The follow-ups every device/rule/specification mutation owes the rest of the board.
 *
 * These four were previously hand-assembled at each of ~10 call sites, in slightly different
 * orders and with slightly different omissions — rule reorder never reported undo availability,
 * and undo/redo never rebuilt the canvas edges. Nothing detected either gap, because a later
 * unrelated refresh usually repaired the state, which made the omissions look harmless.
 *
 * Centralising them turns "remember four things" into one call, so a new mutation cannot forget
 * one and a missing dependency is a type error rather than a silent staleness bug.
