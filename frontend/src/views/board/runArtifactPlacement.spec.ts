/**
 * Where the SMV model download may appear, and where it may not.
 *
 * The model is a **scene-level artifact**: one model is generated per run, and every counterexample
 * that run produced came out of that same model. So the download belongs to the run surfaces
 * (verification result, simulation result, and one button per run row in history) and must not appear
 * on a per-counterexample surface, which would imply one model per counterexample.
 *
 * Three defects sit behind these assertions, all of which typechecked and rendered fine:
 *
 * - the button was gated on a `hasSmvModel` the backend never sent, so it never rendered anywhere and
 *   the feature looked absent rather than broken
 * - it was a footer `--secondary` control beside Close, i.e. styled as an afterthought, which is how
 *   users failed to find it even once it did render
 * - it was offered per counterexample — in the details dialog and on every trace row in history —
 *   handing out the same file N times under a name implying N different models
 *
 * Source-text assertions rather than a mounted render: `Board.vue` is far too large to mount cheaply
 * (see `actionDockHierarchy.spec.ts`). The end-to-end behaviour — that clicking actually delivers a
 * model file — is `e2e/smv-model-download.spec.ts`; this pins the structure that E2E cannot express.
