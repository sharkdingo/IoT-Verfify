/**
 * A verdict that reports more violations than it can show evidence for has to say so.
 *
 * `violatedSpecCount` and the counterexample list come from independent sources: the backend counts
 * `specResults` with `outcome == VIOLATED` (`VerificationServiceImpl.countViolatedSpecs`), while a trace
 * exists only where NuSMV returned a *parseable* counterexample. The product already acknowledges the
 * shortfall as a real state — `app.someViolationsHaveNoReplayableCounterexample` says "Some
 * specifications were violated, but NuSMV did not return a parseable counterexample" — and the run
 * history panel renders it (`TraceHistoryPanel.vue`).
 *
 * The verification result dialog did not, and that is the surface a user lands on the instant a run
 * finishes. So the dialog could read "Violated: 2" beside a list holding one counterexample, or — worse,
 * because the whole section is `v-if="traces?.length"` — beside no list at all, with nothing accounting
 * for the difference. The two readings a user takes from that are both wrong: that the tool lost their
 * evidence, or that one violation is somehow not real.
 *
 * Source-text assertions rather than a mounted render: `Board.vue` is far too large to mount cheaply
 * (see `actionDockHierarchy.spec.ts`).
