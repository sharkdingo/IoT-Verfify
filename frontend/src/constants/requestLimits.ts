 * Credential rules, mirroring the `RequestLimits` credential block.
 *
 * These were hardcoded at each site instead — `Landing.vue` carried its own `10`, `64`, `72` and a literal
 * `^1[3-9]\d{9}$`, duplicating what `RegisterRequestDto` declares. Every other cross-layer limit in this product
 * goes through the mirrored-constants pair precisely so both sides reject identically; the credential rules were
 * the exception, and the convention was a comment with nothing checking it.
 *
 * They agree today. The failure mode is asymmetric drift: lowering the minimum on the server while a hardcoded
 * client check keeps the old one gives a form that refuses what the server would accept, and raising it gives a
 * form that accepts what the server refuses — the second showing the user a rejection on a field whose own hint
 * told them it was fine.
 *
 * `credentialLimitsMirror.spec.ts` reads both files and fails if any value diverges.
