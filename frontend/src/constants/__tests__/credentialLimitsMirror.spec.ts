/**
 * The two layers must reject the same credentials.
 *
 * `REQUEST_LIMITS` has always been described as mirroring the backend's `RequestLimits`, with a comment saying
 * both sides "must reject identically" — and nothing checked it. The credential rules were not even in the
 * mirror: `Landing.vue` carried its own `10`, `64`, `72` and a literal `^1[3-9]\d{9}$`, duplicating what
 * `RegisterRequestDto` declares, under a comment asking the reader to "keep the two in step".
 *
 * They agreed. The failure mode is asymmetric drift, and only one direction is visible in testing: a client that
 * is *stricter* than the server merely refuses something acceptable, while a client that is *looser* shows the
 * user a server rejection on a field whose own hint told them the value was fine. Verified against the live API
 * before centralising — all ten cases behaved correctly, including a 30-character/90-byte password rejected on
 * BCrypt's 72-byte boundary while passing the 10-64 character rule.
 *
 * This reads the Java source rather than importing it, which is the only option across the language boundary, and
 * is why it asserts on the declared constants rather than on behaviour.
