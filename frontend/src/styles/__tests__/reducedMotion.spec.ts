/**
 * Reduced motion stops decoration. It must not stop the one animation that carries information.
 *
 * `.animate-spin` sat in the same `animation: none !important` list as the ping halos and shimmer, so a user
 * with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` saw every spinner frozen mid-rotation. A stopped spinner does not read
 * as "motion is disabled" — it reads as **stalled**, and NuSMV runs take real seconds, so the one thing a user
 * needs during a verification is confidence that it is still alive. Freezing that signal turns a healthy run
 * into an apparent hang, which is the repo's "never present an unknown as a settled outcome" rule pointing the
 * other way.
 *
 * Measured in a browser during a live verification: `1s linear` normally, `2.4s steps(8)` under reduce — still
 * infinite. A slow stepped rotation of a 16px glyph is not the fast, large-area, parallax motion the
 * preference exists to suppress.
 *
 * The probe that confirmed this was wrong twice first, and both failures produced a *zero* that looked like
 * success: an idle board animates nothing, and a fixed 1.5s wait let a small model finish before the
 * measurement. It now waits for a spinner to exist and says so when the run outpaces it.
