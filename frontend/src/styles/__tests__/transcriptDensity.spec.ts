/**
 * A sequential log is one transcript, not one card per line.
 *
 * The verification result dialog is where this product delivers its whole value, and the audit has repeatedly
 * added honesty to it — a frozen-submission snapshot, model-scope caveats, specification results, an engine log,
 * a violation block. Each addition was right on its own. Together they had produced a screen measured at
 * **15 bordered boxes competing as units**, and **7 of those were individual lines of the engine log**, each
 * wearing its own `board-card` border inside an already-bordered section.
 *
 * That is what semantic transparency turning into visual clutter looks like: nothing was inaccurate, but one
 * ordered list was asking the eye to treat seven cumulative lines as seven independent facts. Removing the
 * per-line frames took the dialog to 8 bordered boxes — one per genuine section — while keeping every line
 * present, monospace and scrollable.
 *
 * Measured after the change: 7 lines, 12px, monospace, scrollable, `borderPerLine: false`, and still exactly
 * **one** element at the largest type size, so the verdict keeps its focal point.
 *
 * Pinned because the regression is the natural edit. Reaching for `board-card` on a list item looks like
 * consistency with the surrounding panels, and nothing else would fail.
