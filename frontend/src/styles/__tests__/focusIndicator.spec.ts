/**
 * A focus ring nobody can see is not a focus indicator.
 *
 * The first full keyboard traversal of the board — 36 stops in light, 27 in dark — found every stop named, on
 * screen, and carrying *something*. But **7 of them had a ring under 3:1**, which WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.11 sets as
 * the minimum for a non-text indicator. Three separate hardcoded blues were responsible:
 *
 * | Value | Where | Against its ground |
 * | :--- | :--- | ---: |
 * | `rgba(147, 197, 253, 0.95)` | nav bar controls | **1.72** |
 * | `rgba(53, 158, 255, 0.36)` | canvas fit control | worse |
 * | `rgba(53, 158, 255, 0.32)` | theme + language toggles | **2.76** |
 *
 * All three predate the audit's focus-indicator consolidation and survived it because they are raw `rgba`
 * rather than palette hues, so a sweep for hues did not see them. `--accent-border` is the token `base.css`
 * documents for this job ("also serves as a focus ring") and clears 3:1 in both themes.
 *
 * The template cards were a different defect: they shared hover's styling and then set `outline: none`, so a
 * keyboard user got a lift and a shadow but no ring, and could not tell focused from hovered. The fix had to
 * go on the **inner button** — the card is a `div` wrapping a transparent full-width `button` — and targeting
 * the card looked right while doing nothing in dark theme.
