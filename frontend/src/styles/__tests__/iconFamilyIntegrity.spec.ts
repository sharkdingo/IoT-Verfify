/**
 * Both icon families must stay installed, declared, and mutually fallback-safe.
 *
 * The project deliberately uses two Material families — `material-symbols-outlined` (370 uses) and
 * `material-icons-round` (47, confined to `DeviceDialog`, `RuleBuilderDialog` and `Board`). That is a choice, not
 * drift: both are installed via fontsource, both classes declare an explicit `font-family`, and **each lists the other
 * as its fallback**.
 *
 * That cross-fallback is the load-bearing detail. An icon class whose font fails to resolve does not render a blank —
 * it renders its ligature as literal text, so `expand_more` appears as the word "expand_more" in the middle of the
 * interface. With the fallback in place a round icon degrades to the outlined glyph, which is a visual inconsistency
 * rather than a broken screen.
 *
 * Measured in the browser on a 12-device board: **194 icons, all resolving, median aspect ratio 1.0** — square, as a
 * glyph should be. An unresolved ligature would exceed 2.
 *
 * Pinned at the unit level because the browser probe could only reach the outlined family: the round one renders
 * exclusively inside `DeviceDialog`, which that run never opened. Rather than let the probe claim a comparison it did
 * not make, the structural guarantee is asserted here — the two imports and the two cross-referencing declarations —
 * where it holds regardless of which dialog happens to be on screen.
