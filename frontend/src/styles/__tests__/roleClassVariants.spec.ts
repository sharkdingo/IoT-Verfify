/**
 * A `hover:`/`focus:`/`disabled:`/`dark:` prefix on a hand-written class only works if this repo defines it.
 *
 * Tailwind generates variants for utilities *it* owns. `board-*` and `iot-*` are hand-written in `board.css`, so
 * `hover:board-chip-danger` in a template emitted **nothing** — the class sat in the DOM and no rule matched it.
 * Verified against the built bundle: grepping all 14 emitted CSS files for any `<variant>\:board-*` selector
 * returned zero matches, while the unprefixed base classes were present.
 *
 * That silently disabled **90 declarations** across the components, with nothing detecting it. The ones that
 * mattered, all confirmed in a browser:
 *
 *   - The device delete button asked for `hover:board-chip-danger hover:board-text-danger`. Colour and background
 *     were **identical** on hover (`rgb(97,113,135)`, transparent) — a destructive action with no danger cue.
 *   - Cancel/delete on running verification tasks (5 sites) — same.
 *   - `disabled:board-chip-info` on the runtime save button: the only `disabled:` utility Tailwind could emit
 *     there is `cursor-not-allowed`, so a *disabled* primary kept its accent fill and read as enabled.
 *   - `group-focus-within:board-text-info` on 13 rule-builder select icons — the keyboard-focus cue was absent.
 *
 * There is a second trap this does not catch, recorded here because it cost three attempts: defining the rule is
 * not sufficient if it loses the cascade. The ink variants had to be placed *after* the neutral-text normaliser
 * (`.iot-board .board-side-panel .text-slate-500`), because at equal specificity source order decides. Only CDP
 * matched-styles showed which rule won; the symptom was a danger-tinted background under a grey glyph.
