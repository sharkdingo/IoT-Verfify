/**
 * Every enabled button on the board shows a pointer cursor, from one rule.
 *
 * The mechanism: `<button>` has no default pointer cursor in any browser, so every control must declare one.
 * (This comment used to say "Tailwind's preflight resets `button { cursor: default }`". That is **false** for the
 * installed version — `node_modules/tailwindcss/preflight.css` v4.1.18 contains exactly one occurrence of the word
 * `cursor`, a comment on line 379. Tailwind v4 *removed* v3's added `button { cursor: pointer }`; it does not add a
 * `default`. Same symptom, wrong cause, and a wrong cause sends the next reader looking for a reset that isn't there.)
 * Measured on a real board: **77 of 182 enabled buttons rendered `cursor: default`** — including the entire Control
 * Center tab strip and the panel collapse toggles.
 *
 * Every one of them had hover feedback, so none was undiscoverable. What was wrong is subtler and still worth fixing:
 * the cursor contradicted the appearance. For a pointer user the cursor is the fastest signal that something is
 * clickable, and on a canvas tool that matters more than on a page — a reader assumes most of the surface is inert, so
 * the affordance has to be unambiguous.
 *
 * The fix is one rule in `board.css` rather than 77 component edits, because per-component opt-in is exactly what
 * missed 77 buttons. `:not(:disabled)` is the load-bearing part: a disabled control must keep `default`, or the cursor
 * promises an interaction that will not happen.
 *
 * Also verified in the same pass, and left alone: **zero** inert elements carry `cursor: pointer`. A click that does
 * nothing is indistinguishable from a failed operation, and nothing in the board makes that promise.
