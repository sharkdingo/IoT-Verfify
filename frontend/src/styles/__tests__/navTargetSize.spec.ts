/**
 * Every control in the board nav is a 44px target, at every width.
 *
 * Measured at 1440×900 before the fix: **seven of ten** nav controls were under 44px, and they disagreed with each
 * other — 37px, 39px, 39px, 39px and 40px beside a 44px theme toggle and a 44px language switch. The heights came
 * from padding plus line-height rather than a floor, so each label length produced a slightly different button.
 *
 * This is not a generic accessibility sweep. The strip holds **undo and redo** — the affordance that makes
 * deleting a device recoverable — and the scene commands that clear or replace an entire board, and the logout
 * button that is the only route to account deletion. A user reaching for undo has just done something they want to
 * take back, which is the worst moment to hand them a target smaller than the platform minimum.
 *
 * It had already been half-fixed: a `max-width: 1023.98px` query raised these to `2.75rem`, so **mobile was
 * correct and the desktop case was the exception**. That is exactly the shape a regression takes when the rule
 * lives in a media query instead of in the base declaration, which is why this asserts the base.
