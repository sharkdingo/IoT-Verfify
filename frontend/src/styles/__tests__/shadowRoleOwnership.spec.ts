/**
 * A coloured edge or glow is a semantic signal, so it comes from the role token — never a literal hue.
 *
 * The halo under a destructive button tells the user "this action destroys something". That claim has to hold
 * in both themes, and a literal does not follow a theme: fourteen shadows carried raw light-theme hues
 * (`rgba(239, 68, 68, …)`, `rgba(220, 38, 38, …)`, `rgba(37, 99, 235, …)`, `rgba(124, 58, 237, …)`) while the
 * `background` one line above them was already `var(--danger-fill)` / `var(--accent-fill)`. The fill followed
 * the theme and its own halo did not — the same missed-migration shape `semanticColourOwnership.spec.ts`
 * catches for Tailwind hue utilities, in the hand-written CSS it does not read.
 *
 * Derive from the token the element is painted with: `color-mix(in srgb, var(--danger-fill) 30%, transparent)`.
 *
 * The property list grew twice, each time because a narrower net had let a real defect through:
 * `filter: drop-shadow()` and `text-shadow` hid five edge-state glows, and `border`/`outline`/`stroke` hid
 * `border: 3px solid #EF4444` on the attacked-device ring — the same mark whose pulse *was* tokenised, so one
 * indicator was drawn in two different reds. Hex is checked alongside `rgba()` for the same reason.
 *
 * Neutral shade (`rgba(15, 23, 42, …)`, `rgba(0, 0, 0, …)`) is exempt: that is elevation, not meaning, and it
 * reads correctly on both grounds. This test is about hue.
 *
 * Two exemptions, both narrow and both with a named owner rather than a blanket allowance:
 *
 * - **Focus rings** answer to `focusIndicator.spec.ts`, which measures them against WCAG 1.4.11's 3:1 for a
 *   non-text indicator. Two survivors here (`RuleBuilderDialog` select, the Landing auth input) are the same
 *   class of hardcoded blue that spec was written for — a contrast problem, not a token-plumbing one, so it
 *   belongs to that spec and fixing it blind here could lower a ring below its floor.
 * A `pulse-border` exemption used to sit here for dead code. The dead code is gone, so the exemption went
 * with it — an exemption that outlives what it covered silently forgives the next rule that takes the name.
