/**
 * The action dock has one shape, and its width has one owner.
 *
 * Three modes (`expanded` / `compact` / `packed`) had visibly different geometry because four places each
 * declared their own version of it: `ACTION_DOCK_RAIL_PX` in `Board.vue`, a px pair in the fit math,
 * `--board-action-rail-width` in `board.css`, and a `.board-action-dock--packed { width }` literal. None
 * of the four agreed — the corridor CSS reserved, the width the dock painted, and the width
 * `getVisibleCanvasFrame` subtracted were three different numbers, so fit-to-content could place a node
 * under the rail. Shape drifted the same way: the compact panel had a pill radius against the other two
 * modes' `--iot-radius-panel`, plus its own padding and gap, restated a third time under short landscape.
 *
 * These are cheap to re-break by editing one site and not the others, which is why they are pinned here
 * rather than in a comment.
