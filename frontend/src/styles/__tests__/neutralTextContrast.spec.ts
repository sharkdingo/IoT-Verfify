/**
 * Structural neutrals are legitimate, but not every step of the ramp is legible as text.
 *
 * `semanticColourOwnership.spec.ts` deliberately exempts slate/gray/zinc: they are the structural greys, not
 * semantic roles, and banning them would be wrong. That exemption quietly covered a real defect, though —
 * `text-slate-400` is **2.56:1 on white**, well under the 4.5:1 AA minimum for normal text, and it was used
 * on 103 text elements with no light-theme alternative.
 *
 * It stayed invisible for the whole audit because of a *measurement* bug rather than a reasoning one: Tailwind
 * v4 emits these colours as `oklch()`, the browser probe's colour parser returned nothing for `oklch`, and
 * every element using one was counted "unmeasurable" while the surface still reported CLEAN. A resolver that
 * silently declines to measure turns a defect into an apparent pass.
 *
 * Contrast against a white card, per step:
 *
 * | Step | On white | Verdict |
 * | :--- | ---: | :--- |
 * | `slate-400` | **2.56** | fails normal text; fine as a large decorative glyph or on a dark ground (5.71) |
 * | `slate-500` | 4.76 | passes |
 * | `slate-600` | 7.58 | passes |
 *
 * So the rule is about the *light* theme specifically, and it is narrow: a 400-step neutral is fine inside a
 * `dark:` variant, on an `aria-hidden` glyph, or as a border/background. It fails only as light-theme text.
