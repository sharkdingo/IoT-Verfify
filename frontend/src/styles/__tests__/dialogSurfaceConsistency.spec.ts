/**
 * Every modal is built from styles/dialog.css, and nothing re-derives a dialog shell locally.
 *
 * This exists because the drift was invisible: adding a dialog with its own overlay tint and its own card
 * radius breaks no test and looks fine in isolation. Only when you open two of them in sequence does the
 * product stop reading as one thing — which is how a user reported it, comparing the Clear Scene
 * confirmation with the logout prompt. Measured across 13 hand-rolled modals at the time: 4 overlay tints,
 * 3 card radii, 8 widths, 4 footer alignments and 5 confirm-button heights.
 *
 * These checks are structural, on source text, because the alternative (mounting 13 dialogs and measuring)
 * cannot see a value that a scoped rule overrides later anyway.
