/**
 * A rule for a replay bar must not be written as a descendant of `.iot-board`.
 *
 * Both timeline hosts are `position: fixed` **siblings** of `.iot-board` — `Board.vue` closes the board
 * root before the trace host, and `SimulationTimeline.vue` is a separate component — so every
 * `.iot-board .board-timeline…` selector matches nothing. Nothing fails loudly: the declarations parse,
 * the file looks maintained, and the surface renders with whatever the unprefixed rules happen to give it.
 *
 * This is the third form of one structural mistake, and the first two are documented where they bit:
 * `--board-floating-gap` was unreadable inside a fixed host (the comment near line 1456 of `board.css`),
 * and `.iot-board button` missed 10 of 12 enabled replay controls (`buttonCursor.spec.ts`). Found this
 * time by grepping the prefix rather than by a report, because the symptoms are individually plausible:
 *
 * - `.iot-board .board-timeline [data-testid$="-timeline-close"]` declared the 44px touch floor for both
 *   close buttons inside the narrow/short media query. Dead, so on the viewport where a 44px target
 *   matters most they stayed at the ~32px their padding produced — and `targetSizeFloor.spec.ts` does not
 *   cover this surface, so nothing said otherwise.
 * - Nine colour rules restated the neutral-to-token mapping that the unprefixed `.board-timeline` block
 *   already performs, with **different** values: `--board-card-bg` vs `--surface-muted` for backgrounds,
 *   `--board-panel-bg` vs a `color-mix` overlay for the panel itself. Had the prefix ever matched, the
 *   higher-specificity dead copy would have won and contradicted the measured overlay treatment.
 *
 * So the guard is on the selector shape, not on any one declaration: the mistake is writing a replay-bar
 * rule as a board descendant at all.
