/**
 * A range slider's track must be visible, and the panel field-normaliser must not paint it.
 *
 * `board.css` normalises form fields inside every board panel with
 * `.iot-board .board-floating-panel input, … { background-color: var(--field-bg) }`. At 0-3-0 that beat whatever
 * the markup asked for, and `input` matches `input[type="range"]` as readily as a text box — so both sliders were
 * painted the *panel's own colour*. Measured: **1.0:1** for the simulation-steps track on a white panel, 1.01:1 in
 * dark. The groove was not faint, it was the same colour as the surface behind it, which is exactly how a user
 * reported it: "the line doesn't show".
 *
 * WCAG asks 3:1 for a control boundary, and this repo has already raised two dock borders for that reason. The fix
 * excludes `[type='range']` from the normaliser and paints the track from its role's *border* token
 * (`--info-border` / `--danger-border`, measured 3.14:1 light and 3.81:1 dark) rather than its surface token,
 * whose whole purpose is to sit quietly against a panel.
 *
 * One wrong turn worth recording: the first suspect was the `board-chip-info` class in the markup, and replacing
 * it changed nothing. Only asking the browser which rule actually won named the normaliser. A track colour is
 * decided by the cascade, not by the class list.
