/**
 * A fixed-pixel height on a text container breaks at 200% text size (WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.4).
 *
 * Measured, and the board passes: at a 32px root font — what a browser's 200% text setting actually does — there
 * is **no clipping, no horizontal scroll, and no target below 44px**. Worth pinning the *reason*, because it is
 * one decision away from being false.
 *
 * The reason is that the 173 `h-*` utilities in the markup are rem-based, so they grow with the root font. Only
 * four arbitrary pixel values exist, all `max-h-[…]` on an `iot-scroll-region` — a scroll *cap* rather than a
 * clip, so the content stays reachable. A single `h-[40px]` on a text row would reintroduce the failure, and it
 * would look completely reasonable in review.
 *
 * The probe that established this had two defects first, both of which produced a wrong number rather than an
 * error: it measured a control's own box instead of its effective target (136 false failures against p37's 0 on
 * the same board), and its clipping detector had to be proved capable of firing at all — forced an 8px clip and
 * confirmed it reported 7 elements — because "zero clipping" is indistinguishable from a blind detector.
