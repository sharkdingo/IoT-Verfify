/**
 * The heading outline and landmark names are how a screen-reader user navigates without reading everything.
 *
 * Two defects, both measured on a 12-device board and both invisible to sighted review:
 *
 * **A skipped heading level.** Template card titles were `h4` while the nearest heading above them is the panel's own
 * `h2` ("Control Center"), so the outline read `h1 → h2 控制中心 → h4 Air Conditioner`. A user stepping that outline is
 * told an `h3` exists and hunts for a section that was never there. The group label above the cards
 * ("Default Templates") is a `<span>` inside a `<summary>` and carries no level, so `h3` is the correct rung for the
 * card titles themselves rather than a reason to invent another heading.
 *
 * **An unnamed landmark.** `<section data-testid="environment-pool">` is a bare `<section>` — an implicit `region`
 * landmark — with no accessible name. It was the one unnamed landmark on the board, and an unnamed region is
 * indistinguishable from any other in a landmark list. It already contained an `h3` naming it, so the fix is
 * `aria-labelledby` pointing at that heading: one translated string instead of two that can drift apart.
 *
 * After both: **0 skipped levels, 0 unnamed regions**, in light and dark.
 *
 * Pinned because heading level is the attribute most likely to be chosen for its font size. Nothing about `h4` looks
 * wrong next to an `h2` in a template, and no visual check would catch it.
